# Roadmap

## Milestone 1

Milestone 1 covers the the creation and configuration of types. As a result, `printSchema()` should output a valid GraphQL SDL.

## Milestone 2

Milestone 2 covers query resolvers and the first implementation of Loopack's Inversion-of-Control Context.

## Milestone 3

Milestone 3 covers the implementation of the first mutation.

## Milestone 4

The goal of Milestone 4 is to build out test suites against `graphql({schema, query, variableValues})`. This is the raw, direct usage of the compiled `GraphQLSchema` object, without being used in any particular server or framework.

## Milestone 5

The goal of this milestone is to build out the trivial cases of using `@mschnee/loopback-graphql` with standard frameworks like `express` and `koa`, via `@mschnee/loopback-graphql-express` and `@mschnee/loopback-graphql-koa`

## Milestone 6

Milestone 5 covers the implementation of the first `Component` which can be used in an existing `@loopback` application.
